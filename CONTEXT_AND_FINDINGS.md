# Context and Findings

Running log of changes, bugs, and platform findings for the dual-target
(extension + userscript) Job Copilot.

---

## Turn: 2026-09-18 — Stage 0 and Stage 1: repo split and platform seam

### Files created

- `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT_AND_FINDINGS.md`
- `src/core/platform.js` — host adapter contract
- `src/core/hosts/gm.js` — userscript/Tampermonkey host (default)
- `src/targets/userscript/entry.js` — userscript entry
- `tools/build.js` — dual-target esbuild pipeline

### Files moved

- `Autofill-Ext/src/**` -> `src/core/**` (24 modules, logic unchanged)
- `Autofill-Ext/tests/*.test.js` -> `tests/unit/`
- `Autofill-Ext/fixtures/*` -> `fixtures/`

### Files modified

- `src/core/storage.js` — `gmGet`/`gmSet`/`gmDelete` now delegate to
  `platform.storage`. Added `hasApiKey()` so presence checks work on hosts that
  refuse to expose the key. `resetAll()` clears secrets through the platform.
- `src/core/ai.js` — deleted `sendGMRequest`. Requests go through
  `platform.ai.request`, which the host decorates with `Authorization`. The three
  entry points now guard on `hasApiKey()` instead of reading the key. Core no
  longer holds the API key at any point.
- `src/core/sessions.js` — `bindTab`/`restoreSession` use `platform.tab`.
- `src/core/main.js` — exports `bootstrap()` and `bootstrapWhenReady()` instead
  of self-starting, so a host with async storage can hydrate first. Menu
  registration goes through `platform.menu` behind a capability check.
- `src/core/ui.js` — status pill and autofill guard use `hasApiKey()` rather than
  reading the key. The API key form group is now capability-gated: hosts that set
  `writeSecretsInPage: false` render a link to the extension options page.
- `tests/unit/*` — import paths updated for `src/core/`; `panel.test.js` builds
  the userscript entry; fixture path corrected for the extra directory level.

### Rationale

The port's only hard problem is that core reads storage synchronously while
`chrome.storage` is async. Rather than rewrite ~40 call sites (several inside the
per-field fill loop and the workflow tick), the platform seam keeps the sync
signature and pushes the async problem into a one-time hydration step that the
extension host performs before the panel mounts.

Keeping the GM host as the *default* means a plain bundle behaves exactly like
the original userscript, which is why all existing tests pass untouched apart
from their import paths.

### Verification

- `npm test`: 134 passed, 0 failed (same count as the frozen repo at v0.3.14).
- `npm run build:userscript`: emits `dist/job-copilot.user.js` at v0.4.0 with the
  Tampermonkey banner intact. `panel.test.js` evaluates that bundle in jsdom and
  confirms the panel mounts, captures a job, and persists settings.

### Status

Core is proven host-agnostic while still shipping the working userscript. Next:
the extension shell (manifests, background worker, hydrated storage cache,
OpenRouter proxy, options page, popup).
